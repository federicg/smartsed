you must have installed R with the following libraries :

Rcpp, sp, raster, compositions, gstat, fields, rgdal,
tensorA, bayesm, robustbase, DEoptimR, zoo, spacetime,
xts, intervals, FNN, spam

and the gdal binaries 

before run: modify SMARTSED_input to change input of the deterministic part

to run: execute submission.sub as a bash script, just change res and nsim
res, scaling factor wrt 5 meters, in order to set the desired resolution of the simulation, e.g. if res=4 the elevation model resolution will be 20 meters 
nsim, integer semi-positive number indicating the number of gaussian simulation to perform, 
if zero no gaussian simulation are performed and returns the downscaled particle size fractions which results from the area-to-point regression kriging.
